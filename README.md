# Natural language based graph generator

## Key highlights
- Successfully integrated a Flask-based Python server to process system interaction queries and generate JSON responses.
- Developed a D3.js-powered HTML page to visualize the interactions as a graph, which dynamically fetches data from the Flask server.
- Implemented vector database functionality using Qdrant to enable efficient retrieval of system interaction context.
- Utilized OpenAI's API for natural language understanding to process queries and map them to system interaction data.
- Verified functionality with a sample query, as shown below, which demonstrates the system graph visualization for the query "What are the systems that interact with Admissions Portal?"
